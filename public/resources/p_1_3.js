<h4>Program 1.1 Quick-find solution to connectivity problem</h4>
This program reads a sequence of pairs of nonnegative integers less than
Nfrom standard input (interpreting the pair p q to mean "connect object
p to object q") and prints out pairs representing objects that are not yet
connected. It maintains an array id that has an entry for each object,
with the property that id[p] and id[q] are equal if and only if p and
q are connected. For simplicity, we define N as a compile-time constant.
Alternatively, we could take it from the input and allocate the id array
dynamically (see Section 3.2).

<h3>I.3 Union-Find Algorithms</h3>
<p>
  The first step in the process of developing an efficient algorithm to
  solve a given problem is to implement a simple algorithm that solves
  the problem. If we need to solve a few particular problem instances
  that turn out to be easy, then the simple implementation may finish 
  the job for us. If a more sophisticated algorithm is called for, then the 
  simple implementation provides us with a correctness check for small 
  cases and a baseline for evaluating performance characteristics. We 
  always care about efficiency, but our primary concern in developing 	
  the first program that we write to solve a problem is to make sure that 	
  the program is a correct solution to the problem.
</p>
<p>
  The first idea that might come to mind is somehow to save all 
  the input pairs, then to write a function to pass through them to try 
  to discover whether the next pair of objects is connected. We shall use
  a different approach. First, the number of pairs might be sufficiently
  large to preclude our saving them all in memory in practical applicaÂ­ 
  tions. Second, and more to the point, no simple method immediately 
  suggests itself for determining whether two objects are connected from 
  the set of all the connections, even if we could save them all! We 
  consider a basic method that takes this approach in Chapter 5, but the 
  solve a less difficult problem, and are more efficient, because they 
  not require saving all the pairs. They all use an array of integers-one
  p q, we change all entries with
  corresponding to each object-to hold the requisite information to be 
  able to implement union and find. 	
</p>
<p>
  Arrays are elementary data structures that we shall discuss in
  detail in Section 3.2. Here, we use them in their simplest form: we
  declare that we expect to use, say, 1000 integers, by writing a [1000J;
  then we refer to the ith integer in the array by writing a[iJ for 0 ::;
  i < 1000.
</p>
<p>
  Program I. I is an implementation of a simple algorithm called
  the quick-find algorithm that solves the connectivity problem. The
  basis of this algorithm is an array of integers with the property that
  p and q are connected if and only if the pth and qth array entries
  are equal. We initialize the ith array entry to i for 0 ::; i < N. To
  implement the union operation for p and q, we go through the array,
  changing all the entries with the same name as p to have the same name
  as q. This choice is arbitrary-we could have decided to change all the
  entries with the same name as q to have the same name as p.
</p>
<p>
  Figure 1.3 shows the changes to the array for the union operations in 
  the example in Figure 1.1. To implement find, we just test
  the indicated array entries for equality-hence the name quick find.
  The union operation, on the other hand, involves scanning through
  the whole array for each input pair.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Property I. I</strong> The quick-find algorithm executes at least 
  1\11N instructions to solve a connectivity problem with N objects that involves 1v1
  union operations.
</p>
<p>
  For each of the iV1 union operations, we iterate the for loop N times.
  Each iteration requires at least one instruction (if only to check whether
  the loop is finished).
</p>
<p>
  We can execute tens or hundreds of millions of instructions per
  second on modern computers, so this cost is not noticeable if Iv! and
  N are small, but we also might find ourselves with millions of objects
  and billions of input pairs to process in a modern application. The
  inescapable conclusion is that we cannot feasibly solve such a problem
  using the quick-find algorithm (see Exercise 1.IO). We consider the
  process of quantifying such a conclusion precisely in Chapter 2.
</p>
<p>
  Figure 1.4 shows a graphical representation of Figure I.3. We
  may think of some of the objects as representing the set to which they
  belong, and all of the other objects as pointing to the representative
  in their set. The reason for moving to this graphical representation
  of the array will become clear soon. Observe that the connections
  between objects in this representation are not necessarily the same as
  the connections in the input pairs-they are the information that the
  algorithm chooses to remember to be able to know whether future
  pairs are connected.
</p>
<p>
  The next algorithm that we consider is a complementary method
  called the quick-union algorithm. It is based on the same data
  structure-an array indexed by object names-but it uses a different 
  interpretation of the values that leads to more complex abstract
  structures. Each object points to another object in the same set, in a
  structure with no cycles. To determine whether two objects are in the
  same set, we follow pointers for each until we reach an object that
  points to itself. The objects are in the same set if and only if this
  process leads them to the same object. If they are not in the same set,
  we wind up at different objects (which point to themselves), To form
  the union, then we just link one to the other to perform the union
  operation; hence the name quick-union.
</p>
<p>
  Figure 1.5 shows the graphical representation that corresponds to
  Figure 1.4 for the operation of the quick-union algorithm on the example 
  of Figure 1.1, and Figure 1.6 shows the corresponding changes to
  the id array. The graphical representation of the data structure makes
  it relatively easy to understand the operation of the algorithm-input
  pairs that are known to he connected in the data are also connected to
  one another in the data structure. As mentioned previously, it is 
  important to note at the outset that the connections in the data structure
  are not necessarily the same as the connections in the application 
  implied by the input pairs; rather, they are constructed by the algorithm
  to facilitate efficient implementation of union and find.
</p>
<p>
  The connected components depicted in Figure 1.5 are called trees;
  they are fundamental combinatorial structures that we shall encounter
  on numerous occasions throughout the book. We shall consider the
  properties of trees in detail in Chapter 5. For the union and find
  operations, the trees in Figure I.5 are useful because they are quick to
  build and have the property that two objects are connected in the tree
  if and only if the objects are connected in the input. By moving up the
  tree, we can easily find the root of the tree containing each object, so
  we have a way to find whether or not they are connected. Each tree
  has precisely one object that points to itself, which is called the root
  of the tree. The self-pointer is not shown in the diagrams. When we
  start at any object in the tree, move to the object to which it points,
  then move to the object to which that object points, and so forth, we
  eventually end up at the root, always. We can prove this property to be
  true by induction: It is true after the array is initialized to have every
  object point to itself, and if it is true before a given union operation, it
  is certainly true afterward.
</p>
<p>
  The diagrams in Figure 1.4 for the quick-find algorithm have the
  same properties as those described in the previous paragraph. The
  difference between the two is that we reach the root from all the nodes
  in the quick-find trees after following just one link, whereas we might
  need to follow several links to get to the root in a quick-union tree.
</p>
<p>
  Program 1.2 is an implementation of the union and find operations that 
  comprise the quick-union algorithm to solve the connectivity
  problem. The quick-union algorithm would seem to be faster than the
  quick-find algorithm, because it does not have to go through the entire
  array for each input pair; but how much faster is it? This question is
  more difficult to answer here than it was for quick find, because the
  running time is much more dependent on the nature of the input. By
  running empirical studies or doing mathematical analysis (see Chapter 2), 
  we can convince ourselves that Program 1.2 is far more efficient
  than Program 1.1, and that it is feasible to consider using Program 1.2
  for huge practical problems. We shall discuss one such empirical study
  at the end of this section. For the moment, we can regard quick union
  as an improvement because it removes quick find's main liability (that
  the program requires at least NIt1 instructions to process lvI union
  operations among N objects).
</p>
<p>
  This difference between quick union and quick find certainly
  represents an improvement, but quick union still has the liability that
  we cannot guarantee it to be substantially faster than quick find in
  every case, because the input data could conspire to make the find
  operation slow.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Property 1.2</strong> For M > N, the quick-union algorithm could take
  more than 1\1N /2 instructions to solve a connectivity problem with ]vI
  pairs of N objects.
</p>
<p>
  Suppose that the input pairs come in the order 1-2, then 2-3, then
  3-4 and so forth. After N 1 such pairs, we have N objects all in
  the same set, and the tree that is formed by the quick-union algorithm
  is a straight line, with 1'1 pointing to 1'1 1, which points to 1'1 - 2,
  which points to 1'1 - 3, and so forth. To execute the find operation for
  object 1'1, the program has to follow 1'1 -1 pointers. Thus, the average
  number of pointers followed for the first 1'1 pairs is
  (0+1+ ... +(1'1-1))/1'1=(1'1 1)/2
</p>
<p>
  Now suppose that the remainder of the pairs all connect 1'1 to some
  other object. The find operation for each of these pairs involves at
  least (1'1 1) pointers. The grand total for the j\ll find operations for
  this sequence of input pairs is certainly greater than AIN /2. â¢
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, there is an easy modification to the algorithm that
  allows us to guarantee that bad cases such as this one do not occur.
  Rather than arbitrarily connecting the second tree to the first for union,
  we keep track of the number of nodes in each tree and always connect
  the smaller tree to the larger. This change requires slightly more code
  and another array to hold the node counts, as shown in Program 1.3,
  but it leads to substantial improvements in efficiency. We refer to this
  algorithm as the weighted quick-union algorithm.
</p>
<p>
  Figure 1.7 shows the forest of trees constructed by the weighted
  union-find algorithm for the example input in Figure 1.1. Even for
  this small example, the paths in the trees are substantially shorter than
  for the unweighted version in Figure 1.5. Figure 1.8 illustrates what
  happens in the worst case, when the sizes of the sets to be merged in
  the union operation are always equal (and a power of 2). These tree
  structures look complex, but they have the simple property that the
  maximum number of pointers that we need to follow to get to the root
  in a tree of 2n nodes is n. Furthermore, when we merge two trees of
  2" nodes, we get a tree of 2n+1 nodes, and we increase the maximum
  distance to the root to n + 1. This observation generalizes to provide a
  proof that the weighted algorithm is substantially more efficient than
  the unweighted algorithm.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Property 1.3</strong> The weighted quick-union algorithm follows at most
  2lg 1'1 pointers to determine whether two of 1'1 objects are connected.
</p>
<p>
  We can prove that the union operation preserves the property that the
  number of pointers followed from any node to the root in a set of k
  objects is no greater than 19 k (we do not count the self-pointer at the
  root). When we combine a set of i nodes with a set of j nodes with
    i :::; j, we increase the number of pointers that must be followed in the
  smaller set by 1, but they are now in a set of size i j, so the property
  is preserved because 1 19i 19(i i):::; 19(i + j).â¢
</p>
<p>
  The practical implication of Property I.3 is that the weighted
  quick-union algorithm uses at most a constant times "~,f 19 N instructions 
  to process 11.1 edges on N objects (see Exercise 1.9). This result is
  in stark contrast to our finding that quick find always (and quick union
  sometimes) uses at least A1N/2 instructions. The conclusion is that,
  with weighted quick union, we can guarantee that we can solve huge
  practical problems in a reasonable amount of time (see Exercise LIT).
  For the price of a few extra lines of code, we get a program that is
  literally millions of times faster than the simpler algorithms for the
  huge problems that we might encounter in practical applications.
</p>
<p>
  It is evident from the diagrams that relatively few nodes are
  far from the root; indeed, empirical studies on huge problems tell us
  that the weighted quick-union algorithm of Program 1.3 typically can
  solve practical problems in linear time. That is, the cost of running the
  algorithm is within a constant factor of the cost of reading the input.
  We could hardly expect to find a more efficient algorithm.
</p>
<p>
  We immediately come to the question of whether or not we can
  find an algorithm that has guaranteed linear performance. This question 
  is an extremely difficult one that plagued researchers for many
  years (see Section 2.7). There are a number of easy ways to improve
  the weighted quick-union algorithm further. Ideally, we would like
  every node to point directly to the root of its tree, but we do not want
  to pay the price of changing a large number of pointers, as we did
  in the quick-union algorithm. We can approach the ideal simply by
  making all the nodes that we do examine point to the root. This step
  seems drastic at first blush, but it is easy to implement, and there is
  nothing sacrosanct about the structure of these trees: If we can modify
  them to make the algorithm more efficient, we should do so. We can
  implement this method, called path compression, easily, by adding another 
  pass through each path during the union operation, setting the
  id entry corresponding to each vertex encountered along the way to
  point to the root. The net result is to flatten the trees almost completely, 
  approximating the ideal achieved by the quick-find algorithm,
  as illustrated in Figure 1.9. The analysis that establishes this fact is
  extremely complex, but the method is simple and effective. Figure I. I I
  shows the result of path compression for a large example.
</p>
<p>
  There are many other ways to implement path compression. For
  example, Program 1.4 is an implementation that compresses the paths
  by making each link skip to the next node in the path on the way up
  the tree, as depicted in Figure 1.10. This method is slightly easier to
  implement than full path compression (see Exercise 1.16), and achieves
  the same net result. We refer to this variant as weighted quick-union
  with path compression by halving. Which of these methods is the
  more effective? Is the savings achieved worth the extra time required
  to implement path compression? Is there some other technique that
  we should consider? To answer these questions, we need to look more
  carefully at the algorithms and implementations. We shall return to this
  topic in Chapter 2, in the context of our discussion of basic approaches
  to the analysis of algorithms.
</p>
<p>
  The end result of the succession of algorithms that we have considered 
  to solve the connectivity problem is about the best that we
  could hope for in any practical sense. We have algorithms that are
  easy to implement whose running time is guaranteed to be within a
  constant factor of the cost of gathering the data. Moreover, the algorithms 
  are online algorithms that consider each edge once, using
  space proportional to the number of objects, so there is no limitation
  on the number of edges that they can handle. The empirical studies
  in Table LI validate our conclusion that Program I.3 and its pathcompression 
  variations are useful even for huge practical applications.
  Choosing which is the best among these algorithms requires careful
  and sophisticated analysis (see Chapter 2).
